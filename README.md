# Mem-Maze-Py
attempt to rewrite the java into python (for educational purposes)
The maze in this Python rewrite has more complex movement, and can handle larger maze sizes.
Where the Java game could only generate movement in 3 directions, this one can handle four.

If the generation gets stuck, similar to 'snake', it will re-attempt the maze generation from index 0
